This part is to calculate the 3D target positions in the abstract plan.

Common Rules:

- Think step by step.
- Return the 3D target position for functions 'push_to_position', 'climb_to_position', 'walk_to_position', 'hand_reach_position' used in the plan. 
- You must not assume any position and directly use the variables in the scene information or get the updated position of the objects.
- You must calculate the target position along each dimension, including x,y, and z, and calculate step by step.
- You must reason the spatial relationship between objects when calculating the position, for example, the target position of [OBJECT1] may be dependent on the position of [OBJECT2] and [OBJECT3].
- The 'push_to_position' skill takes the target object position and the object name as input, not the robot's target position. You need to calculate the target object position.
- You must understand that the distance between the two objects' center and the distance between the two objects' edges along an axis are different.
- You must know that each object occupies a bounding box with the size provided in the description. You must consider the 3D geometric information.
- You shouldn't omit any result.
- You can assume that the robot size is (robot_size[0], robot_size[1], robot_size[2]).

Some tips on calculation:
- The height of the top surface of an object is object_position_z + object_size_z / 2. If the object is on the ground, then the height of the top surface is simply object_size_z.
- When the robot is on top of something, then the robot's height is the height of the object's top surface plus robot_size[2]/2. Note the the difference with the case where an object is on another object.
- When the robot is on the ground, the height of the robot center is robot_size[2]/2, not 0.
- When the robot walk to an object, it means that the robot move to next the object, not on the object. Please first reason the direction of the robot with respect to the robot, then determine the the target position of the robot with special care of this direction.
- When two objects are next to each other, the distance between their centers along an axis is half of the sum of their sizes along that axis.
- When the robot is next to or in front of an object, the distance between the robot's center and the object's center along an axis is half of the sum of the robot's size and the object's size along that axis. If the object is perpendicular to any axis, then the axis which align the robot's center and the object's center is that axis.
- Note the difference between height in world coordinate system, and the relative height to a certain platform. To calculate the relative height, you need to use the height in world coordinate system substract the height of the platform.
- Don't omit anything! You should output executable codes.

Example: 

<Current Step>: Use the "walk_to_position" to walk on the top of [OBJECT].
<start of description>
- Since the robot is walking on top of the object, the xy target position is the same as the object position. 
- target_position[0] = object_position[0] and target_position[1] = object_position[1]. You must make sure the robot's xy bounding box is within the range of the [OBJECT]'s xy bounding box. 
- The target position along the z axis is the object_size[2] + robot_size[2]/2.
<end of description>
<start of answer>
The 3D target position is [object_position[0], object_position[1], object_size[2]+robot_size[2]/2].
<end of answer>

If you understand, output 'Yes'. Then, I will provide you the environment description, and the abstract plan. You need to give me target positions for all functions 'push_to_position', 'climb_to_position', 'walk_to_position', 'hand_reach_position' used in the plan.
